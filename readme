How to build BitMagic library:

BM is small software package and you probably can just take the
sources and put it into your project directly. All library sources are in src
directory.

However if you want to use our makefiles you need to follow the next simple
instructions:


Unix:
-----

1. Traditional (in-place build)
- Apply environment variables by runing bmenv.sh :
$ . bmenv.sh

- use GNU make (gmake) to build installation.

$gmake rebuild

or (DEBUG version)
 
$gmake DEBUG=YES rebuild

The default compiler on Unix and CygWin is g++.
If you want to change the default you can do that in makefile.in
(should be pretty easy to do)

2. CMake based build
Project now comes with a set of makefiles for cmake, you can just build it or generate project files for any cmake-supported
environment.


Windows:
--------

If you use cygwin installation please follow general Unix recommendations.
MSVC - solution and projects are available via CMAKE generation

MacOS
---------

XCODE - project files are available via CMAKE generation

Fine tuning and optimizations:
------------------------------

All BM fine tuning parameters are controlled by the preprocessor defines.

=================================================================================

BM library supports CXX-11. Move semantics, noexept, etc.
use
#define BM_NO_CXX11
to explicitly disable use of CXX11 features for your build

=================================================================================

BM library includes some code optimized for 64-bit systems. This optimization 
gets applied automatically.

BM library contains hand tuned code (intrinsics) for SIMD extensions SSE2, SSE4.2, AVX2.

To turn on SSE2 optimization #define BMSSE2OPT in your build environment.
To use SSE4.2  #define BMSSE42OPT (this enables hardware popcount via intrinsics).
SSE42 optimization automatically assumes SSE2 as a subset of SSE4.2. 
(you don’t need to use both BMSSE2OPT and BMSSE42OPT). 
You will need compiler supporting Intel SIMD intrinsics (MSVC, GCC - are ok).

To turn on AVX2 - #define BMAVX2OPT
This will automatically enable AVX2 256-bit SIMD, popcount (SSE4.2) and other 
compatible harware instructions.

BM library does NOT support multiple code paths and runtime CPU identification.
You have to build specifically for your target system or use default portable
build.

To correctly build for the target SIMD instruction set - please set correct 
code generation flags for the build environment.

BitMagic examples and tests can be build with GCC using cmd-line settings: 

make BMOPTFLAGS=-DBMAVX2OPT rebuild
or
make BMOPTFLAGS=-DBMSSE42OPT rebuild

It automatically applies the right set of compiler (GCC) flags for the target 
build.

=================================================================================

BM library uses ‘register’ keyword, but it is disabled now because in C++11 
it is obsolete. 
Use 
#define BMREGISTER register
to turn it on.


=================================================================================

BM library supports "restrict" keyword, some compilers 
(for example Intel C++ for Itanium) generate better
code (out of order load-stores) when restrict keyword is helping. This option is 
turned OFF by default since most of the C++ compilers does not support it. 
To turn it ON please #define BM_HASRESTRICT in your project. Some compilers
use "__restrict" keyword for this purpose. To correct it define BMRESTRICT macro 
to correct keyword. 

=================================================================================


Bitcounting optimization can be turned ON by defining BMCOUNTOPT.
Please note this optimization is not completely thread safe and in general may not
be needed on systems with SSE4.2 and up with available harware popcnt and vectrization. 
bvector<> template keeps mutable variable inside it and update it 
when it count() function is called. It creates a certain chance that this
function will be called from multiple threads and conflict/crash on updating this 
variable.

If BMCOUNTOPT is not defined (default) BM library should be considered thread
safe for all reads - all "const" on functions, methods, parameters are honored. 

=================================================================================

If you want to use BM library in STL-free project you need to define
BM_NO_STL variable. It will disable inclusion of certain headers and also 
will make bvector iterators incompatible with STL algorithms 
(which you said you are not using anyway).

This rule only applies to the core bvector methods. Auxiliary algorithms may use 
STL.

=================================================================================
